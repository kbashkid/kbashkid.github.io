        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>How can we use our horrors?</p>
        <p>The inspiration of this website is my fascination with the novel <b><span class="house">House</span> of Leaves</b> by Mark Z. Danielewski. If I had time each tab would <span class="house">house</span> a blog explorings different aspects of the book. Throughout this website, I have imitated the types of fonts used in <b><span class="house">House</span> of Leaves</b> and techniques, such as the coloring of the word <span class="house">"house"</span></p>
        <p>Feel free to look around, however. You should be able to navigate the site freely</p>
