        <h2>Signifying signs</h2>
        <p>This would be a blog about semiological chains in <b><span class="house">House</span> of Leaves</b>. Mark Z. Danielewski structures the novel in the form of an academic monograph, with footnotes, citations, and notes from the editors. The novel is ostensibly about Johnny Truant, a 20 something year-old man who discovers the notes for an unpublished book analyzing <b>The Navidson Record</b> (a film with no evidence of existing) in the apartment of his recently passed neighbor, the blind Zampano. This story is told throughout the footnotes of the notes that Johnny edited and sent to be published. Danielewski plays with the structure as Truant's sanity deteriates throughout the book. Interesting stuff I'd like to write about.</p>
